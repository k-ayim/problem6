# problem 6

This Java program calculates the exponentiation of a number using recursion.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the `Problem6ExponentiationRecursive.java` file using a Java compiler.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled program.
   - Enter the base number and exponent when prompted.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will output the result of the base raised to the power of exponent.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `power` method is O(n), where n is the exponent. This is because the method makes n recursive calls until the exponent becomes 0, resulting in linear growth.
